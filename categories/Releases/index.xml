      <description>Apache Camel 4.4 (LTS) has just been released.&#xA;This release introduces a set of new features and noticeable improvements that we will cover in this blog post.&#xA;Camel Core The simple language has been improved with hash function, and further improved the embedded functions for jsonpath, jq and xpath making it easier to grab data from JSon or XML within your simple expression or predicates.&#xA;We have optimized data formats to avoid converting payload to byte[] when unmarshalling, but allowing each data format to unmarshal the payload as-is.</description>

      <description>The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 3.4.2, a new patch release for the 3.4 LTS version with 6 new features, improvements and fixes.&#xA;The main reason we are releasing this version is that we compiled 3.4.1 with Java 11 which leads to issues as described in this Github issue. Although we already have a fix for this problem (see CAMEL-15309), we found that it would be safer to push out a release compiled with Java 8 so nobody gets affected by this or any similar problems.</description>
