      <title>How to have textual Yaml editing support in VS Code for Camel Yaml files</title>

      <description>Camel provides possibilities to define Integrations using Yaml language. It is the language often used for people dealing with Kubernetes/OpenShift. This language doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same maturity than xml or java but there are tooling that can help a lot. Given that yaml specification doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow self-described yaml metadata, several conventions are introduced to provide edition support of Yaml files. This article will focus on Camel Yaml files, both plain Yaml and Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) inside VS Code.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel is a project in constant transformation. Anyone knows that Camel has been able to adapt to any new kinds of protocols and systems that have emerged in the past 15 years. But it&amp;rsquo;s not only that: Camel is also able to adapt to any new ways of dealing with integration problems in the cloud era. While Camel K represented a fundamental shift towards a new approach to cloud-native integration, &amp;ldquo;Kamelets&amp;rdquo; are driving a deeper transformation towards &amp;ldquo;low code&amp;rdquo; development.</description>
