## Installation

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this component:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-kubernetes</artifactId>
    <version>x.x.x</version>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
```

## Usage

### Producer examples

Here we show some examples of producer using camel-kubernetes.

### Create a pod

```java
from("direct:createPod")
    .toF("kubernetes-pods://%s?oauthToken=%s&operation=createPod", host, authToken);
```

By using the `KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_POD_SPEC` header, you can specify your PodSpec and pass it to this operation.

### Delete a pod

```java
from("direct:createPod")
    .toF("kubernetes-pods://%s?oauthToken=%s&operation=deletePod", host, authToken);
```

By using the `KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_POD_NAME` header, you can specify your Pod name and pass it to this operation.

## Using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets

The `camel-kubernetes` component also provides [Property Placeholder](../../manual/using-propertyplaceholder.md) functions that load the property values from Kubernetes _ConfigMaps_ or _Secrets_.

For more information, see [Property Placeholder](../../manual/using-propertyplaceholder.md).

## Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using kubernetes with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-kubernetes-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
```

The component supports 91 options, which are listed below.

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-config-maps.autowired-enabled** | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-config-maps.bridge-error-handler** | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-config-maps.enabled** | Whether to enable auto configuration of the kubernetes-config-maps component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-config-maps.kubernetes-client** | To use an existing kubernetes client. The option is a io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClient type. |  | KubernetesClient |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-config-maps.lazy-start-producer** | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel’s routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-cronjob.autowired-enabled** | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean |

Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible. In other situations we may improve the Camel component to hook into the 3rd party component and make this possible for future releases. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-services.enabled** | Whether to enable auto configuration of the kubernetes-services component. This is enabled by default. |  | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-services.kubernetes-client** | To use an existing kubernetes client. The option is a io.fabric8.kubernetes.client.KubernetesClient type. |  | KubernetesClient |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-services.lazy-start-producer** | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel’s routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | Boolean |
| **camel.component.openshift-build-configs.autowired-enabled** | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean |

This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean |
| **camel.component.openshift-deploymentconfigs.bridge-error-handler** | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions (if possible) occurred while the Camel consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. Important: This is only possible if the 3rd party component allows Camel to be alerted if an exception was thrown. Some components handle this internally only, and therefore bridgeErrorHandler is not possible.
