# Google Pubsub

**Since Camel 2.19**

**Both producer and consumer are supported**

The Google Pubsub component provides access to [Cloud Pub/Sub Infrastructure](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) via the [Google Cloud Java Client for Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://github.com/googleapis/java-pubsub).

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their pom.xml for this component:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-google-pubsub</artifactId>
    <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    <version>x.x.x</version>
</dependency>
```

## URI Format

The Google Pubsub Component uses the following URI format:

google-pubsub://project-id:destinationName?\[options\]

Destination Name can be either a topic or a subscription name.

## Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

-   component level
    
-   endpoint level
    

### Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints. For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the [Component DSL](../../manual/component-dsl.md), in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

### Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from) or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use the [Endpoint DSL](../../manual/Endpoint-dsl.md) and [DataFormat DSL](../../manual/dataformat-dsl.md) as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints and data formats in Java.

A good practice when configuring options is to use [Property Placeholders](../../manual/using-propertyplaceholder.md), which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings. In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.

## Component Options

The Google Pubsub component supports 10 options, which are listed below.

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **authenticate** (common) | Use Credentials when interacting with PubSub service (no authentication is required when using emulator). | true | boolean |
| **endpoint** (common) | Endpoint to use with local Pub/Sub emulator. |  | String |
| **serviceAccountKey** (common) | The Service account key that can be used as credentials for the PubSub publisher/subscriber. It can be loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. |  | String |
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean |
| **synchronousPullRetryableCodes** (consumer) | Comma-separated list of additional retryable error codes for synchronous pull. By default the PubSub client library retries ABORTED, UNAVAILABLE, UNKNOWN. |  | String |
| **lazyStartProducer** (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel’s routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean |
| **publisherCacheSize** (producer) | Maximum number of producers to cache. This could be increased if you have producers for lots of different topics. |  | int |
| **publisherCacheTimeout** (producer) | How many milliseconds should each producer stay alive in the cache. |  | int |
| **autowiredEnabled** (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean |
| **publisherTerminationTimeout** (advanced) | How many milliseconds should a producer be allowed to terminate. |  | int |

## Endpoint Options

The Google Pubsub endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

google-pubsub:projectId:destinationName

with the following path and query parameters:

### Path Parameters (2 parameters)

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **projectId** (common) | **Required** The Google Cloud PubSub Project Id. |  | String |
| **destinationName** (common) | **Required** The Destination Name. For the consumer this will be the subscription name, while for the producer this will be the topic name. |  | String |

### Query Parameters (15 parameters)

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **authenticate** (common) | Use Credentials when interacting with PubSub service (no authentication is required when using emulator). | true | boolean |
| **loggerId** (common) | Logger ID to use when a match to the parent route required. |  | String |
| **serviceAccountKey** (common) | The Service account key that can be used as credentials for the PubSub publisher/subscriber. It can be loaded by default from classpath, but you can prefix with classpath:, file:, or http: to load the resource from different systems. |  | String |
| **ackMode** (consumer) | 
AUTO = exchange gets ack’ed/nack’ed on completion. NONE = downstream process has to ack/nack explicitly.

Enum values:

-   AUTO
    
-   NONE
    





 | AUTO | AckMode |
| **concurrentConsumers** (consumer) | The number of parallel streams consuming from the subscription. | 1 | Integer |
| **maxAckExtensionPeriod** (consumer) | Set the maximum period a message ack deadline will be extended. Value in seconds. | 3600 | int |
| **maxMessagesPerPoll** (consumer) | The max number of messages to receive from the server in a single API call. | 1 | Integer |
| **synchronousPull** (consumer) | Synchronously pull batches of messages. | false | boolean |
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer (advanced)) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean |
| **exceptionHandler** (consumer (advanced)) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler |
| **exchangePattern** (consumer (advanced)) | 

Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.

Enum values:

-   InOnly
    
-   InOut
    
-   InOptionalOut
    





 |  | ExchangePattern |
| **lazyStartProducer** (producer (advanced)) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel’s routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean |
| **messageOrderingEnabled** (producer (advanced)) | Should message ordering be enabled. | false | boolean |
| **pubsubEndpoint** (producer (advanced)) | Pub/Sub endpoint to use. Required when using message ordering, and ensures that messages are received in order even when multiple publishers are used. |  | String |
| **serializer** (producer (advanced)) | **Autowired** A custom GooglePubsubSerializer to use for serializing message payloads in the producer. |  | GooglePubsubSerializer |

## Message Headers

The Google Pubsub component supports 5 message header(s), which is/are listed below:

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CamelGooglePubsubMessageId** (common) Constant: [`MESSAGE_ID`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-google-pubsub/latest/org/apache/camel/component/google/pubsub/GooglePubsubConstants.html#MESSAGE_ID) | The ID of the message, assigned by the server when the message is published. |  | String |
| **CamelGooglePubsubMsgAckId** (consumer) Constant: [`ACK_ID`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-google-pubsub/latest/org/apache/camel/component/google/pubsub/GooglePubsubConstants.html#ACK_ID) | The ID used to acknowledge the received message. |  | String |
| **CamelGooglePubsubPublishTime** (consumer) Constant: [`PUBLISH_TIME`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-google-pubsub/latest/org/apache/camel/component/google/pubsub/GooglePubsubConstants.html#PUBLISH_TIME) | The time at which the message was published. |  | Timestamp |
| **CamelGooglePubsubAttributes** (common) Constant: [`ATTRIBUTES`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-google-pubsub/latest/org/apache/camel/component/google/pubsub/GooglePubsubConstants.html#ATTRIBUTES) | The attributes of the message. |  | Map |
| **CamelGooglePubsubOrderingKey** (producer) Constant: [`ORDERING_KEY`](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.camel/camel-google-pubsub/latest/org/apache/camel/component/google/pubsub/GooglePubsubConstants.html#ORDERING_KEY) | If non-empty, identifies related messages for which publish order should be respected. |  | String |

## Producer Endpoints

Producer endpoints can accept and deliver to PubSub individual and grouped exchanges alike. Grouped exchanges have `Exchange.GROUPED_EXCHANGE` property set.

Google PubSub expects the payload to be byte\[\] array, Producer endpoints will send:

-   String body as byte\[\] encoded as UTF-8
    
-   byte\[\] body as is
    
-   Everything else will be serialised into byte\[\] array
    

A Map set as message header `GooglePubsubConstants.ATTRIBUTES` will be sent as PubSub attributes.

Google PubSub supports ordered message delivery.

To enable this set set the options messageOrderingEnabled to true, and the pubsubEndpoint to a GCP region.

When producing messages set the message header `GooglePubsubConstants.ORDERING_KEY` . This will be set as the PubSub orderingKey for the message.

More information in [Ordering messages](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/ordering).

Once exchange has been delivered to PubSub the PubSub Message ID will be assigned to the header `GooglePubsubConstants.MESSAGE_ID`.

## Consumer Endpoints

Google PubSub will redeliver the message if it has not been acknowledged within the time period set as a configuration option on the subscription.

The component will acknowledge the message once exchange processing has been completed.

If the route throws an exception, the exchange is marked as failed and the component will NACK the message - it will be redelivered immediately.

To ack/nack the message the component uses Acknowledgement ID stored as header `GooglePubsubConstants.ACK_ID`. If the header is removed or tampered with, the ack will fail and the message will be redelivered again after the ack deadline.

## Message Body

The consumer endpoint returns the content of the message as byte\[\] - exactly as the underlying system sends it. It is up for the route to convert/unmarshall the contents.

## Authentication Configuration

By default this component aquires credentials using `GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault()`. This behavior can be disabled by setting _authenticate_ option to `false`, in which case requests to Google API will be made without authentication details. This is only desirable when developing against an emulator. This behavior can be altered by supplying a path to a service account key file.

## Rollback and Redelivery

The rollback for Google PubSub relies on the idea of the Acknowledgement Deadline - the time period where Google PubSub expects to receive the acknowledgement. If the acknowledgement has not been received, the message is redelivered.

Google provides an API to extend the deadline for a message.

More information in [Google PubSub Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber#ack_deadline)

So, rollback is effectively a deadline extension API call with zero value - i.e. deadline is reached now and message can be redelivered to the next consumer.

It is possible to delay the message redelivery by setting the acknowledgement deadline explicitly for the rollback by setting the message header `GooglePubsubConstants.ACK_DEADLINE` to the value in seconds.

## Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using google-pubsub with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-google-pubsub-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
```
