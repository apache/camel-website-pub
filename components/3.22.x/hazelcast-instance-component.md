# Hazelcast Instance

**Since Camel 2.7**

**Only consumer is supported**

The [Hazelcast](http://www.hazelcast.com/) instance component is one of Camel Hazelcast Components which allows you to consume join/leave events of the cache instance in the cluster. Hazelcast makes sense in one single "server node", but it’s extremly powerful in a clustered environment.

## Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

-   component level
    
-   endpoint level
    

### Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints. For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the [Component DSL](../../manual/component-dsl.md), in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

### Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from) or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use the [Endpoint DSL](../../manual/Endpoint-dsl.md) and [DataFormat DSL](../../manual/dataformat-dsl.md) as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints and data formats in Java.

A good practice when configuring options is to use [Property Placeholders](../../manual/using-propertyplaceholder.md), which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings. In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.

## Component Options

The Hazelcast Instance component supports 4 options, which are listed below.

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean |
| **autowiredEnabled** (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean |
| **hazelcastInstance** (advanced) | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don’t specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. |  | HazelcastInstance |
| **hazelcastMode** (advanced) | The hazelcast mode reference which kind of instance should be used. If you don’t specify the mode, then the node mode will be the default. | node | String |

## Endpoint Options

The Hazelcast Instance endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

hazelcast-instance:cacheName

with the following path and query parameters:

### Path Parameters (1 parameters)

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **cacheName** (consumer) | **Required** The name of the cache. |  | String |

-   capacity
    





 |  | HazelcastOperation |
| **hazelcastInstance** (consumer) | The hazelcast instance reference which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. |  | HazelcastInstance |
| **hazelcastInstanceName** (consumer) | The hazelcast instance reference name which can be used for hazelcast endpoint. If you don’t specify the instance reference, camel use the default hazelcast instance from the camel-hazelcast instance. |  | String |
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer (advanced)) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean |
| **exceptionHandler** (consumer (advanced)) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. |  | ExceptionHandler |
| **exchangePattern** (consumer (advanced)) | 

Sets the exchange pattern when the consumer creates an exchange.

Enum values:

-   InOnly
    
-   InOut
    
-   InOptionalOut
    





 |  | ExchangePattern |

## instance consumer - from("hazelcast-instance:foo")

The instance consumer fires if a new cache instance will join or leave the cluster.

Here’s a sample:

```java
fromF("hazelcast-%sfoo", HazelcastConstants.INSTANCE_PREFIX)
.log("instance...")
.choice()
    .when(header(HazelcastConstants.LISTENER_ACTION).isEqualTo(HazelcastConstants.ADDED))
        .log("...added")
        .to("mock:added")
    .otherwise()
        .log("...removed")
        .to("mock:removed");
```

## Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using hazelcast-instance with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-hazelcast-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
</dependency>
```
