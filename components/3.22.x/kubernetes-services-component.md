# Kubernetes Services

**Since Camel 2.17**

**Both producer and consumer are supported**

The Kubernetes Services component is one of [Kubernetes Components](kubernetes-summary.md) which provides a producer to execute Kubernetes Service operations and a consumer to consume events related to Service objects.

## Configuring Options

Camel components are configured on two separate levels:

-   component level
    
-   endpoint level
    

### Configuring Component Options

The component level is the highest level which holds general and common configurations that are inherited by the endpoints. For example a component may have security settings, credentials for authentication, urls for network connection and so forth.

Some components only have a few options, and others may have many. Because components typically have pre configured defaults that are commonly used, then you may often only need to configure a few options on a component; or none at all.

Configuring components can be done with the [Component DSL](../../manual/component-dsl.md), in a configuration file (application.properties|yaml), or directly with Java code.

### Configuring Endpoint Options

Where you find yourself configuring the most is on endpoints, as endpoints often have many options, which allows you to configure what you need the endpoint to do. The options are also categorized into whether the endpoint is used as consumer (from) or as a producer (to), or used for both.

Configuring endpoints is most often done directly in the endpoint URI as path and query parameters. You can also use the [Endpoint DSL](../../manual/Endpoint-dsl.md) and [DataFormat DSL](../../manual/dataformat-dsl.md) as a _type safe_ way of configuring endpoints and data formats in Java.

A good practice when configuring options is to use [Property Placeholders](../../manual/using-propertyplaceholder.md), which allows to not hardcode urls, port numbers, sensitive information, and other settings. In other words placeholders allows to externalize the configuration from your code, and gives more flexibility and reuse.

The following two sections lists all the options, firstly for the component followed by the endpoint.

## Component Options

The Kubernetes Services component supports 4 options, which are listed below.

   
| Name | Description | Default | Type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **kubernetesClient** (common) | **Autowired** To use an existing kubernetes client. |  | KubernetesClient |
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean |
| **lazyStartProducer** (producer) | Whether the producer should be started lazy (on the first message). By starting lazy you can use this to allow CamelContext and routes to startup in situations where a producer may otherwise fail during starting and cause the route to fail being started. By deferring this startup to be lazy then the startup failure can be handled during routing messages via Camel’s routing error handlers. Beware that when the first message is processed then creating and starting the producer may take a little time and prolong the total processing time of the processing. | false | boolean |
| **autowiredEnabled** (advanced) | Whether autowiring is enabled. This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | boolean |

## Endpoint Options

The Kubernetes Services endpoint is configured using URI syntax:

kubernetes-services:masterUrl

with the following path and query parameters:

### Path Parameters (1 parameters)

| **resourceName** (consumer) | The Consumer Resource Name we would like to watch. |  | String |
| **bridgeErrorHandler** (consumer (advanced)) | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | boolean |
| **exceptionHandler** (consumer (advanced)) | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this option is not in use.

 |  | ExchangePattern |
| **operation** (producer) | Producer operation to do on Kubernetes. |  | String |

## Supported producer operation

-   listServices
    
-   listServicesByLabels
    
-   getService
    
-   createService
    
-   deleteService
    

## Kubernetes Services Producer Examples

-   listServices: this operation list the services on a kubernetes cluster
    

```java
from("direct:list").
    toF("kubernetes-services:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listServices").
    to("mock:result");
```

This operation return a List of services from your cluster

-   listServicesByLabels: this operation list the deployments by labels on a kubernetes cluster
    

```java
from("direct:listByLabels").process(new Processor() {
            @Override
            public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
                Map<String, String> labels = new HashMap<>();
                labels.put("key1", "value1");
                labels.put("key2", "value2");
                exchange.getIn().setHeader(KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_SERVICE_LABELS, labels);
            }
        });
    toF("kubernetes-services:///?kubernetesClient=#kubernetesClient&operation=listServicesByLabels").
    to("mock:result");
```

This operation return a List of Services from your cluster, using a label selector (with key1 and key2, with value value1 and value2)

## Kubernetes Services Consumer Example

```java
fromF("kubernetes-services://%s?oauthToken=%s&namespace=default&resourceName=test", host, authToken).process(new KubernertesProcessor()).to("mock:result");

    public class KubernertesProcessor implements Processor {
        @Override
        public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
            Message in = exchange.getIn();
            Service sv = exchange.getIn().getBody(Service.class);
            log.info("Got event with configmap name: " + sv.getMetadata().getName() + " and action " + in.getHeader(KubernetesConstants.KUBERNETES_EVENT_ACTION));
        }
    }
```

This consumer will return a list of events on the namespace default for the service test.

## Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

When using kubernetes-services with Spring Boot make sure to use the following Maven dependency to have support for auto configuration:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.camel.springboot</groupId>
  <artifactId>camel-kubernetes-starter</artifactId>
  <version>x.x.x</version>
  <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->

This is used for automatic autowiring options (the option must be marked as autowired) by looking up in the registry to find if there is a single instance of matching type, which then gets configured on the component. This can be used for automatic configuring JDBC data sources, JMS connection factories, AWS Clients, etc. | true | Boolean |
| **camel.component.kubernetes-pods.bridge-error-handler** | Allows for bridging the consumer to the Camel routing Error Handler, which mean any exceptions occurred while the consumer is trying to pickup incoming messages, or the likes, will now be processed as a message and handled by the routing Error Handler. By default the consumer will use the org.apache.camel.spi.ExceptionHandler to deal with exceptions, that will be logged at WARN or ERROR level and ignored. | false | Boolean |
