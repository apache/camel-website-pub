      <title>Using Camel annotations with LangChain4j high level api available in next Camel Quarkus release</title>
      <link>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2024/10/langchain4j-camel-annotations/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2024/10/langchain4j-camel-annotations/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In a previous blog post, we have seen how Camel could be used to transform raw unstructured text into structured Java objects. The shown example actually uses the LangChain4j high level API where a Java interface will handle the interactions needed with the underlying Large Language Model. However, at this time, a Quarkus LangChain4j issue prevented the usage of the Camel parameter binding annotations. This issue will be fixed in the next Camel Quarkus release, so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it will work.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2024/10/camel-upgrade-recipes-release-4.8.0/</guid>
      <description>This blog post introduces a Camel Upgrade Recipes project and shows an example of its usage.&#xA;Introduction Migrating Apache Camel code can often be a tedious and error-prone process, especially when it involves repetitive tasks like renaming classes, updating method signatures, or adapting to new Camel API changes. To address this need, Camel Upgrade Recipes project based on OpenRewrite was developed. The project is not designed to provide fully automated migration but rather to assist with manual migrations, making them more efficient and less error-prone.</description>

      <description>The first law of software complexity says that &amp;ldquo;a well-designed system will degrade into a badly designed system over time&amp;rdquo;. This law can be ruthless for open source projects receiving hundreds of contributions every month.&#xA;That&amp;rsquo;s why projects must refactor code, evaluate APIs, review tests, and modernize code to leverage the latest and greatest features from Java.&#xA;Camel Test Support One area in Camel that has had little attention until recently was our test support code.</description>

      <description>In the last 2.2.0 version release, Camel K added an interesting feature that gave the users the possibility to build their Camel application externally and run via the operator with certain limitations. In this blog we&amp;rsquo;re trying to analyze those limitations and provide some example that will show you how to possibly leverage this feature.&#xA;What is a &amp;ldquo;sourceless&amp;rdquo; Integration? With a great effort of creativity (sarcasm), we have named this feature as &amp;ldquo;sourceless&amp;rdquo; Integration.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel 4.5 has just been released.&#xA;This release introduces a set of new features and noticeable improvements that we will cover in this blog post.&#xA;Camel Core When using Kamelets and/or Rest DSL then Camel will now hide their intermediate routes and only show user routes. The number of routes that Camel logs on startup is thus only the number of user routes. This also avoids cluttering up the list of routes in monitoring and management tools.</description>

The data type functionality has been added on top of the well-known Transformer EIP that is a part of Apache Camel since the beginning.&#xA;This post gives a short introduction to the concept of data types and continues with several examples that show how to use those data types in Camel for instance as a form of Camel route contracts.</description>

The good news is there are only a few changes with the move to Micrometer Metrics.&#xA;From Microprofile to Micrometer Camel K 2.0 was the occasion to move from one technology (Microprofile) to another (Micrometer) for the Prometheus trait configuration implementation.&#xA;The reason is the deprecation notice from Quarkus Microprile&amp;rsquo;s implementation in favor of using Micrometer Metrics.</description>

      <description>One of the main effort we&amp;rsquo;re putting in Camel K version 2 is to have a enterprise grade building system. Not that Camel K version 1 has not this capability, but some of the key features are not very explicit. So I thought that, while waiting for Camel K version 2 release, where we&amp;rsquo;re making all this configuration explicit, I can share some tip on how to improve the capacity to build and have a production enterprise ready environment also in Camel K 1.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel 4 is on the way for 1st half in 2023.&#xA;The need for Camel 4 is mainly driven by Java open source projects migrating from javax to jakarta APIs and to keep up with popular runtimes such as Spring Boot and Quarkus.&#xA;Primary Goals Migrate from javax -&amp;gt; jakarta (JEE 10) Java 17 as minimum Spring Framework 6 Spring Boot 3 Quarkus 3 Release Goals Release only what is ready (JEE10 / Java17) This means that Camel components that are not ready (yet) will be dropped in a release until they are ready.</description>

      <title>Load properties from Vault/Secrets cloud services: introducing Camel Context automatic refresh on secrets updates</title>
      <link>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2022/12/camel-context-reloading-secret-refresh/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2022/12/camel-context-reloading-secret-refresh/</guid>
      <description>Starting from Camel 3.19.0 we have four cloud services supported for loading properties as secrets:&#xA;AWS Secret Manager Google Cloud Secret Manager Azure Key Vault Hashicorp Vault One of the problems we faced in the development was related to finding a way to automatically refresh the secret value on the secrets update.&#xA;The main players in the cloud game are providing solutions based on their services: AWS provides multiple ways to be notified about secret updates and secret rotations through AWS Cloudtrail or AWS Cloud events, GCP leverages Google Pubsub to deliver messages with events related to secret, while Azure provides multiple ways of getting notified about events related to a vault in the Azure Key Vault service, mostly by using Azure Eventgrid as an intermediate service.</description>

      <description>Testing is probably one of those operations we use to repeat most of the time while building any application. Applications in Camel world are no difference. With the advent of Camel JBang, we have a unified place that can be used to perform our testing/fine tuning locally before moving to a higher environment.&#xA;During the last years of development, we have noticed that testing or fine tuning an integration directly connected to a Cloud Native environment can result a bit cumbersome.</description>

      <description>Camel K offers a wide list of operations you can execute once your Integration has been deployed (likely in a production environment). When we talk about operations, the most typical question we got is &amp;ldquo;How to monitor a Camel K Integration?&amp;rdquo;. Fortunately, we have all the ingredients needed to let you manage this operation as smooth as possible. I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through the different tools and configuration needed in this blog post.</description>

      <description>\&#xA;A new input mapping system has been added to Camel Designer. But what that even means ?!?&#xA;Well, better to be seen, but if explained, it&amp;rsquo;s an effort to provide a more intuitive configuration system for Camel route steps. On one hand, it simplifies the view of a route by compacting route steps, and on the other hand, it provides an easy drag-and-drop mapping ability to map process variables to activity inputs.</description>

      <description>The Integration is the resource which represents the actual Camel application and building a container image that packages the integration within an elevated cloud platform (be it locally in a Minikube or K8s hosted cluster to Openshift clusters) takes ample amount of time.&#xA;Enhancing the Camel-K Integration build time Our goal was to reduce overhead and improve user experience. We were able to narrow down the major contributors that had a significant influence on the integration build time.</description>

In this blogpost, I will describe the process for a Camel Quarkus application. I&amp;rsquo;m using VS Code as example but similar pattern is possible in other IDEs.&#xA;Please note that it is working only with Quarkus in JVM mode and not Native mode.</description>

      <description>For Camel 3.16.0 we are removing the deprecated container-based test modules and replacing them with a new set of modules called Camel test-infra.&#xA;They continue to support container-based tests via TestContainers, however they abstract the underlying test infrastructure.&#xA;One of the great benefits for our project is that they allow us to more easily switch from container-based tests, to external instances. Previously, we would need to create a new test or implement a more complex design if we wanted to test both a container instance and an external service instance (i.</description>

      <description>NOTE: this post has first appeared in the author&amp;rsquo;s blog.&#xA;KEDA (Kubernetes Event Driven Autoscalers) is a fantastic project (currently CNCF incubating) that provides Kubernetes-based autoscalers to help applications to scale out according to the number of incoming events when they are listening to several kinds of event sources. In Camel K we&amp;rsquo;ve long supported Knative for providing a similar functionality for integrations that are triggered by HTTP calls, so supporting KEDA was something planned since long time, because it enables full autoscaling from a wider collection of sources.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel 3.15.0 introduces a new Dynamic Router EIP component. Although Camel core includes a Dynamic Router processor, I wanted a Dynamic Router implementation that was much closer, and more adherent, to the EIP specification.&#xA;The Dynamic Router as a &amp;ldquo;glue&amp;rdquo; component, not a messaging server It is important to note that, while this implementation of the Dynamic Router is a component, it is not meant to be a component for some type of messaging system (like JMS, etc.</description>

      <description>Camel provides possibilities to define Integrations using Yaml language. It is the language often used for people dealing with Kubernetes/OpenShift. This language doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the same maturity than xml or java but there are tooling that can help a lot. Given that yaml specification doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow self-described yaml metadata, several conventions are introduced to provide edition support of Yaml files. This article will focus on Camel Yaml files, both plain Yaml and Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) inside VS Code.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel is a project in constant transformation. Anyone knows that Camel has been able to adapt to any new kinds of protocols and systems that have emerged in the past 15 years. But it&amp;rsquo;s not only that: Camel is also able to adapt to any new ways of dealing with integration problems in the cloud era. While Camel K represented a fundamental shift towards a new approach to cloud-native integration, &amp;ldquo;Kamelets&amp;rdquo; are driving a deeper transformation towards &amp;ldquo;low code&amp;rdquo; development.</description>

      <description>We recently started to review, investigate and fix reliability issues with the Kafka component. As part of that, we refactored the code to avoid problematic concurrency patterns, remove calls to deprecated Kafka client code and simplify the overall maintainability of the code. This led to many changes in the internal implementation of the component, which we will talk about in this blog post.&#xA;Motivation The ground work related to these changes can be traced back to the following set of issues reported on our Jira.</description>

      <description>Kamelets (Kamel route snippets) are a new concept introduced in Camel K that allow users to connect to external systems via a simplified interface, hiding all the low level details about how those connections are implemented. There are several ways to consume them. One of them is as standard Camel Components. In this case, completion is provided to fill the template id and the parameter names. It is currently based on a fixed set of Kamelets provided by a snapshot of the kamelet catalog.</description>

      <description>Hello Camel riders!&#xA;I created a tool which allows to draw a PlantUML activity diagram from a running Camel context (not at design time).&#xA;The above image shows what kind of diagram you can expect.&#xA;I find it useful when I need to have a overall view of interactions between all the routes and endpoints, or to have a visual representation for better understanding and documentation.&#xA;You can find all the details on the public GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>Problem description Multicast is a powerful EIP which supports parallel execution paths in asynchronous manner. There are various ways a Camel user can configure a multicast EIP. Check out the extensive documentation here&#xA;One can configure to execute all the child paths independently and continue routing the last reply as the outgoing message (default behavior unless you provide an aggregation strategy) Additionally, you can plug in an implementation of a Camel aggregation strategy with user-defined logic to aggregate the output from each of those child paths before continuing further downstream routing.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re starting a new initiative at Apache Camel to create a community-driven catalog of reusable Kamelets (Camel route snipp_ets_, i.e. connectors) that can be used to stream data from/to external systems into any platform powered by Apache Camel.&#xA;The &amp;ldquo;Apache Camel Kamelet catalog&amp;rdquo; is available here and it already contains a collection of useful Kamelets: we would like to extend it with help of the community.&#xA;Kamelets are currently supported out-of-the-box by the Apache Camel K project and we&amp;rsquo;re working to support them also in Camel core, so that they can run eventually in any Apache Camel subproject, like Camel Kafka Connector (but also camel-quarkus, camel-spring-boot, &amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 3.4.2, a new patch release for the 3.4 LTS version with 6 new features, improvements and fixes.&#xA;The main reason we are releasing this version is that we compiled 3.4.1 with Java 11 which leads to issues as described in this Github issue. Although we already have a fix for this problem (see CAMEL-15309), we found that it would be safer to push out a release compiled with Java 8 so nobody gets affected by this or any similar problems.</description>

      <description>Camel and Camel Quarkus are typically used to create integration applications that run as long living processes, a.k.a. daemons or services.

      <description>Apache Camel 3 was released last thursday November 28th 2019, which also happens to be the day of the US Thanksgiving. This was not intentionally but we can say its a big thanks from us to the community with a brand new major version of Camel - this does not come often by. In fact, its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>
